# Triangles

Recursively divide triangles.

There are two functions available in the `main.js` file to divide based on one
point `divideTriangleSinglePoint`, or on the midpoint of the hypotenuse
`divideTriangleHypotenuse`.

## ToDo

Make the canvas dimensions dynamic so that the script will run no matter what
dimensions the canvas is.

## Base

This project is built using the [quick gulp][1] project created for this exact
reason.
